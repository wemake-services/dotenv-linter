Rules about writing correct dotenv values.

By convention we do not print values to the output.

    Restricts to write values with trailing spaces.

    Reasoning:
        These spaces are not guaranteed to be preserved.
        So, it is better not to rely on them.

    Solution:
        Remove trailing spaces from the value.

class QuotedValueViolation(BaseFSTViolation):
    """
    Restricts to quoted values.

    Reasoning:
        Dotenv parser usually strips quotes away, so it is hard to say
        whether these quotes will stay on a final value, or not.

    Solution:
        Remove any quotes from the value.

    Example::

        # Correct:
        KEY=1

        # Wrong:
        KEY="1"

class InvalidEOLViolation(BaseFSTViolation):

    Restricts to use `\r\n` (CRLF) end-of-line.

    Reasoning:
        Mixing different end-of-line chars can lead to different
        hard-to-debug problems.

    Solution:
        Use `\n` (LF) end-of-line.
        Another option is to add line `text eol=lf` to `.gitattributes`.
